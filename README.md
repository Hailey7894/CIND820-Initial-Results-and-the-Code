Tentative stages of the project:
1. Clean the dataset for intended use.
2. Application of Johansen Cointegration test in VECM model.
3. Replicate the prior work of Melike and Fulya using R: application of ARDL model and Granger casality test.
4. Examine the results of the code and compare the difference between Melike & Fulya's research method and Johansen test in VECM model.
